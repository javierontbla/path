A **Pathfinding Visualizer** is a tool with the objective of displaying (in real-time) how a searching algorithm works to find the closest path between two nodes on a grid.

### What algorithms can you choose?

I implemented two types of algorithms, pathfinding and maze generation algorithms.

**Pathfinding Algorithms**

- _A\*_ - One of the most used path search algorithm due to its completeness, optimality and efficency. Is the fastest one of the three and it already knows the location of the **end node**.
  <br />
- _Dijkstra_ -
  <br />
- _Breadth First Search_ - The algorithm starts at the called 'search key' and it continues to explore **all** of the neighbor nodes at the present depth.

**Maze Generation Algorithms**

- _Recursive Divison_ -
- _Sidewinder_ -

<br />

### How to use it?

First, fill the grid with obstacles (pressing down your mouse over the grid) or choose a Maze Generation Algorithm to do it for you. Then select a searching algorithm (left side) and click the **Play** button (in the middle) to visualize it.
